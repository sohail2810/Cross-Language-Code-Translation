## Introduction:
This project aims to develop an efficient and accurate code-to-code language model that can effectively translate source code to the target programming language while maintaining proper syntax. The project is focused on the translation of Java code to Python code, but the model can be extended to other programming languages as well.

Requirements:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyTorch 1.7.0 or higher
- Transformers 4.0.0 or higher
- Java-Python parallel corpus

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages using pip or conda.
3. Download the Java-Python parallel corpus and place it in the data directory.
4. Run the preprocessing script to preprocess the data.
5. Train the model using the train script.
6. Evaluate the model using the evaluate script.

## Usage:
- The preprocessing script preprocesses the data by removing comments and appending language-specific keywords for effective tokenization.
- The train script trains the model using the preprocessed data and saves the trained model in the models directory.
- The evaluate script evaluates the trained model on the test data and reports the accuracy and other metrics.
